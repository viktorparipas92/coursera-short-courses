# # L2: Data Exploration for Tuning a Foundation Model

# **Project environment setup:**
# 
# - Load credentials and relevant Python Libraries
# - If you were running this notebook locally, you would first install Vertex AI. In this classroom, this is already installed.
# 
# ```
# !pip install google-cloud-aiplatform
# ```
# - You can download the `requirements.txt` for this course from the workspace of this lab. `File --> Open...`

# In[1]:


from utils import authenticate


credentials, PROJECT_ID = authenticate() 


# In[2]:


REGION = 'us-central1'


# - Import the [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) SDK.
# - The library helps to interact with the Vertex AI services in the cloud.
# - Initialize it. 

# In[3]:


import vertexai


# In[4]:


vertexai.init(
    project=PROJECT_ID,
    location=REGION,
    credentials=credentials,
)


# - Import [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) to use as your data warehouse.
# - Initialize the client to start interacting with the data warehouse, send SQL and retrieve data into the notebook.

# In[5]:


from google.cloud import bigquery


# In[10]:


bigquery_client = bigquery.Client(
    project=PROJECT_ID,
    credentials=credentials,
)


# ## Stack Overflow Public Dataset

# - You will use [Stack Overflow Data](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/public-datasets/google-bigquery-public-datasets-now-include-stack-overflow-q-a) on BigQuery Public Datasets.
# - The datasets include questions, answers and metadata related to Stack Overflow questions. Within this dataset, there are tables with data.
# - Create a SQL query.

# In[11]:


QUERY_TABLES = """
SELECT
  table_name
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`
"""


# - The query is asking to retrieve `table_name` of all the `TABLES`
# - Use the client to send your SQL and retrieve the data (tables names).

# In[12]:


query_job = bigquery_client.query(QUERY_TABLES)


# In[13]:


for row in query_job:
    for value in row.values():
        print(value)


# ## Data Retrieval

# - You'll fetch some data from the data warehouse and store it in Pandas dataframe for visualization.
# - Select all columns from  `posts_questions` and put the `LIMIT` as 3.

# In[14]:


INSPECT_QUERY = """
SELECT
    *
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
LIMIT 3
"""


# In[15]:


import pandas as pd


# In[17]:


query_job = bigquery_client.query(INSPECT_QUERY)


# - Take the results of the query `-->` create an arrow table (which is part of [Apache Framework](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/index.html)) `-->` which goes into a Pandas dataframe.
# - This allows for data to be in a format which is easier to read and explore with Pandas.

# In[18]:


stack_overflow_df = (
    query_job.result().to_arrow().to_pandas()
)
stack_overflow_df.head()


# ### Dealing with Large Datasets
# 
# - Large datasets for LLMs often don't fit into memory.
# - Select all of the columns and rows of the table `posts_questions`.

# In[19]:


QUERY_ALL = """
SELECT
    *
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` q
"""


# In[20]:


query_job = bigquery_client.query(QUERY_ALL)


# In[ ]:


try:
    stack_overflow_df = (
        query_job.result().to_arrow().to_pandas()
    )
except Exception as e:
    print('The DataFrame is too large to load into memory.', e)


# **Note:** The data is too large to return, as it is not fitting into memory.

# #### Joining Tables and Query Optimization
# 
# - When working with (large) data, query optimizing is needed in order to save time and resources.
# - Select questions as `input_text` (column 1), answers as `output_text` (column 2).
# - Take the questions from `posts_questions` and answers from `posts_answers`.
# - Join the questions and their corresponding accepted answers based on their same `unique ID`.
# - Making sure the question is about `Python`, and that it `has an answer`. And the date the question was posted is on or after `2020-01-01`
# - Limit as 10,000

# In[21]:


QUERY = """
SELECT
    CONCAT(q.title, q.body) as input_text,
    a.body AS output_text
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` q
JOIN
    `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers` a
ON
    q.accepted_answer_id = a.id
WHERE
    q.accepted_answer_id IS NOT NULL AND
    REGEXP_CONTAINS(q.tags, "python") AND
    a.creation_date >= "2020-01-01"
LIMIT
    10000
"""


# In[22]:


query_job = bigquery_client.query(QUERY)


# In[23]:


# this may take some seconds to run
stack_overflow_df = query_job.result().to_arrow().to_pandas()
stack_overflow_df.head(2)


# ### Adding Instructions
# 
# - Instructions for LLMs have been shown to improve
# model performance and generalization to unseen tasks [(Google, 2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf).
# - Wihtout the instruction, it is only question and answer. Model might not understand what to do.
# - With the instructions, the model gets a guideline as to what task to perform.

# In[24]:


INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE = f"""\
Please answer the following Stack Overflow question on Python. \
Answer it like you are a developer answering Stack Overflow questions.

Stack Overflow question:
"""


# - A new column will combine `INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE` and the question `input_text`.
# - This avoids overwritting of any existing column which might be needed.

# In[26]:


stack_overflow_df['input_text_instruction'] = (
    f"{INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE} {stack_overflow_df['input_text']}"
)


# ### Dataset for Tuning
# 
# - Divide the data into a training and evaluation set. By default, 80/20 split is used.
# - This (80/20 split) allows for more data to be used for tuning. The evaluation split is used as unseen data during tuning to evaluate performance.
# - The `random_state` parameter is used to ensure random sampling for a fair comparison. 

# In[27]:


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split


# In[28]:


training_set, evaluation_set = train_test_split(
    stack_overflow_df,
    test_size=0.2,  # 20% for evaluation
    random_state=42,
)


# #### Different Datasets and Flow
# 
# - Versioning data is important.
# - It allows for reproducibility, traceability, and maintainability of machine learning models.
# - Get the timestamp.

# In[29]:


import datetime


# In[30]:


date = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%H:%d:%m:%Y')


# - Generate a `jsonl` file.
# - Name it as `tune_data_stack_overflow_python_qa-{date}`

# In[35]:


columns = ['input_text_instruction','output_text']
data_jsonl = training_set[columns].to_json(orient='records', lines=True)


# In[36]:


training_data_filename = f'tune_data_stack_overflow_python_qa-{date}.jsonl'


# In[38]:


with open(training_data_filename, 'w') as file:
    file.write(data_jsonl)


# ## Try it Yourself! - Evaluation Set
# 
# The code above generted a `jsonl` file for the `train` set. Now, its time for you to make the `evaluation` set, which you can name as `tune_eval_data_stack_overflow_python_qa-{date}.jsonl`. The code for that is also provided to you in the drop down below, but we encourage you to try it yourself first before you look at it.
# 
# <details>
#   <summary><font size="2" color="darkgreen"><b>Code for Evaluation Set (Click to expand)</b></font></summary>
#     
# ```python
# 
# cols = ['input_text_instruct','output_text']
# ### you need to use the "evaluation" set now
# tune_jsonl = evaluation[cols].to_json(orient="records", lines=True)
# 
# ### change the file name
# ### use "tune_eval_data_stack_overflow_python_qa-{date}.jsonl"
# evaluation_data_filename = f"tune_eval_data_stack_overflow_\
#                             python_qa-{date}.jsonl"
# 
# ### write the file
# with open(evaluation_data_filename, "w") as f:
#     f.write(tune_jsonl)
